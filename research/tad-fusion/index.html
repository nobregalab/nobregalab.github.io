Topologically associating domains, or TADs, are sections of chromosomes that self-segregate. Gene regulators within the TADs regulate genes within the TADs, and often cannot access genes that are outside their TAD.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the boundaries of a TAD are disrupted, there may be severe consequences for the expression of genes in neighboring TADs. Two regions that used to be separate may fuse, and gene regulators may access and affect new sets of genes. In this way, mutations that do not contain any genes could have large effects on gene expression, with potentially severe consequences for an organism.</p>
<p>In this project, we plan to identify instances of TAD fusion throughout the genome, with a focus on TADs encompassing childhood epilepsy genes. In collaboration with the <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/carvilllab/">Carvill Lab</a> at Northwestern University, we hope to find new, noncoding mutations affect TAD boundaries, and that explain severe cases of childhood epilepsy.</p>
